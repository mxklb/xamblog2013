title: Going North – Picton to Wellington
---

Today we took a boat from the south island to the north island. 
Everything went well so we’re in Wellington now! Feels quit good 
to be in a city after such a long time in the nature, meeting many 
tourists all the time. So the new year will ne celebrated with 
the kiwis – cheers dudes…
